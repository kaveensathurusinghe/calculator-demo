# PyTest Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi, I'm demonstrating PyTest, Python's most popular testing framework used by Django, Flask, and thousands of projects worldwide."

[Show terminal with project]
`ls -la`
"This is our calculator project with comprehensive PyTest tests."

## Feature 1: Simple & Powerful (45 seconds)
"PyTest requires zero configuration - just name your files test_*.py"

`pytest tests/test_basic_operations.py -v`

"Notice the clean output, automatic test discovery, and clear pass/fail indicators. No boilerplate code needed."

## Feature 2: Fixtures (45 seconds) 
"PyTest's fixture system provides clean dependency injection."

[Show conftest.py briefly]
`cat tests/conftest.py`

"This calculator fixture gets automatically injected into our tests. No manual setup/teardown needed."

## Feature 3: Parametrized Testing (45 seconds)
"One test function can generate multiple test cases:"

`pytest tests/test_parametrized_demo.py -v`  

"See how one test definition created 7 different test cases? This reduces code duplication and improves test coverage."

## Feature 4: Coverage Integration (30 seconds)
"PyTest integrates seamlessly with coverage tools:"

`pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`

"We have 100% coverage, and PyTest shows exactly which lines are tested."

## Feature 5: Error Reporting (30 seconds)
"PyTest provides excellent error reporting:"

`pytest tests/test_demo_failure.py::test_intentional_failure_demo -v`

"Clear failure messages show exactly what went wrong, where, and provide context for debugging."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"PyTest is the industry standard because it's simple to start with, yet powerful enough for complex testing needs. It's used by major Python projects and has an extensive plugin ecosystem."
